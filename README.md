This is an Enfusion Workbench plugin to dump all of the files from the Resource Browser to the local file system. The main use case for this is an easier method to search for things in the various configs and file formats. As far as I'm aware, the only file search that is currently possible is for script files. The dump could also be useful for diffing after a game update to get a more detailed idea of exactly what changed.

The only places files can be written to is `$save` and `$profile`, and this plugin writes to the `$profile`. The default location `$profile` location for me on Windows 11 is `C:\Users\Username\Documents\My Games\ArmaReforger\profile\`. This plugin will write to a folder named `Dump` within the profile directory. The directory structure of the game will be respected when writing the dump. For example, this path within the Resource Browser `ArmaReforger\Missions\ConflictWithoutAIs.conf` would be written to the local file system in `C:\Users\Username\Documents\My Games\ArmaReforger\profile\Dump\ArmaReforger\Missions\ConflictWithoutAIs.conf`.

The code for this plugin is based on the `SampleMod_WorkbenchPlugin` released by [Bohemia Interactive on their GitHub](https://github.com/BohemiaInteractive/Arma-Reforger-Samples).

## Installation

Clone this project into your addons folder. There is also a version on the Reforger Workshop you can download (but you may want to compare the date of the last version to ensure it is up-to-date).

In the Enfusion Workbench Launcher, click the 'Add Existing' button and select ReforgerDumper's `addon.gproj` file. Open the 'Reforger Dumper' project. The plugin will now be available from within that project.

Since this tool is for dumping the Reforger base files, there is no need to incorporate this plugin with another project. However, if you wish to do so, in the Enfusion Workshop Launcher you can right click on the project you wish to use it with and use the 'Open with addon(s)' option.

## Using the Reforger Dumper
While you have the Enfusion Workbench open, press Ctrl + D to open the UI for the plugin. Then press the "Dump" button in the bottom right of the dialog. Your Workbench will be unresponsive while the dump is taking place.

You can deselect file types from the list to have them not included in the dump. There is also a checkbox at the bottom for whether files in the `WorkbenchGame` directory should be **excluded** from the dump. This is enabled by default.

As the `profile` directory is part of the Resource Browser's search, **you will want to move the dump to another directory outside of the profile after it has been completed**, otherwise you'll have duplicated files. It seems like the Workbench will also lag for a bit after the dump has completed which I'm assuming is because it's indexing all of the files that were just written to the `profile`. It's probably worth closing it while you move the dumped files and then reopen it after.

## Reloading Workbench Plugins
If you make an edit to the plug, you can reload Workbench Plugins by hitting Ctrl + Shift + R. If you made a change to the dialog options when opening the UI for the plugin you may need to go to Plugins > Settings > Clear All Settings, or restart the Workbench.
